1. The standard MNIST dataset is used to test the Deep Neural Network implemented using Tensorflow.

2. In the simple neural network:

[0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1] -  Training set inputs.
[0,         1,         1,         0      ] -  Training set outputs.
Note: The output is the first element in every training example.
[1, 0, 0] - Testing set input.
